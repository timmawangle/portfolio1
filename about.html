                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey, I'm Tim Wang. I am a junior at the University of Michigan's School of Information studying UI/UX Design and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Creating and designing have been lifelong passions of mine, and I strive to create beautiful and efficient designs that bridge the gap between technology and people.</p>
                <p>Recently, I have been working on creating designs for a bubble tea mobile-order application. The project is completely self-led.</p>
                <p>I wanted to combine two of my interests into a project that would provide a meaningful learning experience about design and marketing.
                    I constantly strive to learn more about design, and I am excited for what's next.
                </p>
