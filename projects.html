            <h1>Automated Bubble Tea Machine</h1>
            <p>In the summer of 2018, I interned at a startup called QuantumBots.<br>
                We worked towards creating an automated bubble tea assembly machine utilizing
                the Arduino API, microcontrollers, and thermoelectric coolers. </p>
            <p>My role within the company was to design, code, and test the prototypes of the machines. 
                This entire process spanned over 6 weeks.</p>
            <div class="ht"><img src="imgs/HT.png" alt="history terminator UI"/></div>
            <h2>History Terminator</h2>
            <p>With a time window of just two days, I worked on developing and publishing the Google extension History Terminator. 
                It is a simple but powerful extension that allows users to quickly and conveniently clear their browser history and caches with a single click.
                Prioritizing user experience, the extension also features an easy to use minimalistic design that declutters the process of clearing history.
            </p>
            <p>History Terminator was a self-lead project with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, the Google Extension API, 
                and overall, how to develop and publish Google extentions. </p>
